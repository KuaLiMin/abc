She was attentive, acknowledged my feelings and facilitated me to think cohesively. She then concluded the session by giving me some insight as to what might be one of the sources of the issues I had and told me to do some research by observation and discuss it in the next session. She also said that she would like for me to focus on one issue and a time so that we could work on it slowly. Overall, it went great ðŸ™‚</p>

                <p class="m-0 col-12 text-right pt-4">Iâ€™ve had a good experience with Venting Spaces so far. Staff have been very responsive in fixing up appointments with my counsellor Leon and tending to my queries. My experience with Leon has also been great. As someone who has never had formal counselling, I approached the first session with some apprehension. However, Leon was patient and professional in explaining the process and clarifying the approach that he would adopt. It also helped to know that we are aligned in expectations. I very much look forward to working with him as I journey towards my recovery.</p>
